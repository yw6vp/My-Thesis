Within each experiment grouping, data is grouped by type of laser used (B = Broadband, N = Narrowband). $I_0$ is the nominal incident laser intensity at the center of the pumping chamber. $T_{pc}^{set}$ is the oven set temperature. $P_{pc}^\infty $ is the equilibrium polarization in the pumping chamber and $\Gamma _s$ is the slow time constant extracted from the five parameter fit to the polarization build up curve. $\Gamma _c$ is the cell-averaged room temperature spin relaxation rate. $\delimiter "426830A P_A\delimiter "526930B /P_A^l$ is the volume averaged to line averaged alkali polarizaiton ratio determined from the optical pumping simulation. $P_A^l$ is the measured line averaged alkali polarization. $D_{fr} \& D_{pb}$ are the K to Rb density ratios determined from Faraday rotation and pressure broadening measurements. [Rb]$_{fr}$ is the Rb number density measured from Faraday rotation. $\Delta T_{He}$ is the temperature of Rb inferred from the number density relative to the oven set temperature. $\Delta T_{He}$ is the temperature of $^3$He inferred from temperature tests relative to the oven set temperature. X is the best combined value for the X-factor. $^\star $ indicates X was measured using only spinup, alkali polarization, and Faraday rotation data. $^\dagger $ indicates X was also measured using the early-time behavior of the spinup.\relax }}{2}}
